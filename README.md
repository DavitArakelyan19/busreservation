# Bus Reservation System

This simple Bus Reservation System is designed to manage bus-related activities such as ticket purchases, cancellations, and checking bus status. The system allows users to interact through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

- Dynamic Initialization: User-defined number of buses with origin, destination, total seats, and fare.
- Menu-Driven Interface: Easy-to-use interface for purchasing tickets, canceling tickets, and checking bus status.
- Data Storage: Structured data storage using arrays for buses.

## Getting Started

1. Compile the Code:
   - Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Compile the code using: gcc -o bus_reservation_system bus_reservation_system.c.

2. Run the Executable:
   - Execute the compiled program: ./bus_reservation_system (Linux/macOS) or bus_reservation_system.exe (Windows).

3. Interact with the System:
   - Follow the displayed menu to perform actions such as ticket purchase, cancellation, and bus status check.
   - Input choices as prompted.

4. Exit the System:
   - Select option 4 to exit the program.

## Code Structure

- Main Function (`main`):
  - Orchestrates the program flow.
  - Manages the main menu and user interactions.

- Bus Struct:
  - Defines the structure to represent a bus with attributes like busNumber, origin, destination, totalSeats, availableSeats, and fare.

- Functions:
  - initializeBuses: Initializes an array of buses by capturing user input for bus details.
  - displayMenu: Displays the available menu options.
  - purchaseTicket, cancelTicket, checkBusStatus: Placeholder functions for ticket-related operations.

## Further Development

1. Algorithm Implementation:
   - Develop algorithms within placeholder functions for purchasing tickets, canceling tickets, and checking bus status.

2. Input Validation:
   - Implement robust input validation mechanisms to handle unexpected user inputs.

3. Enhanced User Interface:
   - Continuously improve the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.

4. Real-Time Data Integration:
   - Consider integrating real-time data updates for features like bus tracking and dynamic seat availability.

Feel free to contribute and enhance the functionality of this Bus Reservation System.

Note: This system is a basic template and may require additional development for a complete bus reservation solution.
